SACM is the student chapter of the [Association for Computing Machinery][2] at the University of Wisconsin. SACM exists to provide professional and social activities for CS graduate students. SACM is a Registered Student Organization (RSO) at UW-Madison, and follows [Student Organization Resource & Policy Guide][3]. 

To be a member of the national ACM and get journals and discounts on conferences, you must join the national ACM directly and pay fees to it, but you do not need to do that to be involved in SACM.
